		<h3> description: </h3><p> "UN-broken" tells a story about a girl who's insecurities about her "image" get to her head. She feels as if her weight is too much, that she's too short, and that she isn't pretty enough. Although on social media she appears happy with her life, behind the camera, she feels lost and trapped in her pessimistic world. She thinks everyone sees her insecurities as well and concludes that they all hate her for it. It isn't until the people she befriended tell her otherwise that she's beautiful no matter what she thinks. Her friends help her get out of the darkness she created, thus her accepting them as her new light. This video art is a reflection of how I felt about myself until I met friends that made me feel proud to be me and not matter about how I look. I wanted to show my experiences and how people can change one's thoughts on anything. It is the people that bring love to us and it is up to us to let them in and gladly accept their love.

		<h3> process: </h3><p> i first came up with the idea as i was brainstorming how i could represent my newfound knowledge i acquired from my art 75 class. i then thought of artworks that i used as references. this led to the overall outcome of my storyboard for the project. with the help of friends and family, i was able to record multiple scenes and compile them together to create this successful art video. it was kind of difficult working with people i know because there were many times that we would just outburst in laughter. however, we managed to get the job done. i used a DLSR Canon Rebel T6 and my Samsung Galacy 10 to record everything. i then edited all the files into Adobe's Premiere Pro using cuts, transitions, color-correcting, and text. </p>
