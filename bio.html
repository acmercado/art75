		<h3> artist statement </h3>	
		<p> My name is Almarie-Crista Mercado and I am a third-year at San Jose State University working towards a BFA in Digital Media Art (DMA). As an artist, I care about being able to create something for the enjoyment of the process, for the bettering of the self, and for the ignition of inspiration that may light within the audience. It also matters to me that one is able to convey their intended message clearly in the artwork that they create. In all of my artworks, I try to explore ways of how I can input personal experiences others can empathize with, worldly problems I believe should be talked about, or subjects I believe are beautiful and fit my aesthetics. I believe these messages should be communicated through art because I believe that art is generally more appealing to the eyes, making people stop to look at them and think about the message the artwork is trying to portray. As for creating something out of the artist’s sheer interest and enjoyment, I believe art is an outlet for the artist to express his/her feelings that can not be truly voiced. </p>
		<p> . . . </p>
		<p> Although I am majoring in DMA, I do not have a specific medium at the moment. This is due to the fact that I explore different mediums through the art courses I enroll into for my major. By learning new ways to create art, it makes me want to continuously experiment with different things until I find something I want to keep doing for the rest of my art career. However, aside from higher education, I started my art career with just graphite and paper, and I am currently trying to transition into doing more digital illustrations. Unfortunately, I have not been making artwork that is not school-related, therefore my process pertains to the specific class it is for whether it is my Art 68, Sculpture, class or my Art 75, Introduction to Video Art, class. This means my art processes would range from welding, casting, video-recording, and coding. Although whenever I do get the chance to create something that is not for school, it is usually a digital illustration on my 2-in-1 laptop using Adobe’s PhotoShop and a stylus. I feel like my artworks for my classes are more “message” driven, whereas my personal drawings are just for fun: usually reflecting topics of what I enjoy at the moment or show my level of experience with the specific medium. However, I believe that this shows that my approach with my artwork varies respectively to a “professional” environment or a “casual” environment. This means that I could be fairly serious when it comes to an important piece for work or be rather playful for a piece that I know would be just for my eyes. </p>
